Updated Personal Repository for COMP 20

The purpose of this repository is to showcase our coursework.

My favorite deliverable was Lab 5, Duck Hunt. Although I knew of JavaScript (JS), this lab formally introduced me to the language; it was the first time I wrote and used JS, and especially to manipulate 2D graphics with HTML's canvas. The exercise was an eye-opener and the process of discovery was encouraging.

Since commencement of the course, I posses improved skills and greater confidence in understanding various technologies. For example, in this course we covered HTML, CSS, JS, Git repository, developer tools, etc. In another course we covered internet security vulnerabilities, and in a third course, we were introduced to C++ and how to logically dissect problems and devise solutions. There is only so much content that each course can cover in a semester and I am far from proficient in everything we were taught, but collectively, the courses provided a solid foundation upon which to enhance my computer engineering skillset.

There are two lessons that were reinforced in this course: 
1. The solutions to programming enigmas are neither always avaiable nor easily understood, at least not initially, and typically not for the consecutive 50 attempts. My ethos is to minimize the frustration and maximize the enjoyment of learning at every opportunity, e.g. creating UX, code and documentation that is easy to interact with.
2. Overcommitted workloads are catastrophic to productivity and learning, but perseverance is crucial. I found myself overloaded with courses - two were intense and time-consuming, and for all three I knew very little or nothing of the material. This was the most demanding semester I have ever experienced but I am still committed to developing my problem solving and programming experience.

Now that we finished the course, I would you like to continue to refine my front-end skills, and delve deeper into server-side development.
